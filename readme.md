# Drupal theme for the Twitter Bootstrap system

## We've abandoned work on this for now. Don't use.
This was a work in progress, but now we are using the [Drupal Bootstrap theme](https://drupal.org/project/bootstrap), which is being actively maintained. It's great.

Alternatively you could use [Stanford's Open Framework theme](https://openframework.stanford.edu/) which is also based on Bootstrap. But, we haven't had as much luck with it.

## Install instructions
Did you read the message above?

* git clone git://github.com/scimusmn/drupal_twitter_bootstrap.git sites/all/themes/dtb
* ./install.sh

The install script uses git to pull the appropriate version of the Twitter Bootstrap system as a submodule of this repo.
